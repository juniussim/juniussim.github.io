	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hi, my name is Junius Sim. I’m a programmer, designer and marketer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nope. I’m not one of those who picked up programming when i was 8 years old. I started a little later. I only started learning to design and code when I was 25. The reason I started so late was because those geeks in school did not share with me how much fun it was to code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Long story short, I’m not a mad scientist. I’m just someone who’s passionate about programming because it allows me to express myself and build products that my friends and I enjoy fantasizing about.
	</p>
	<p class="next-section">
		I created this blog to share what i've learned on design and programming. For the next few months, you'll mostly find short posts relating to programming (with a focus on javascript) on my blog. And occassionally you will hear a little on design and marketing.
